PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS:
- Overall completion rate: ${completionRate}%
- Recently completed tasks: ${successfulTaskTypes.join(', ') || 'None yet'}
- Areas needing attention: ${stuckAreas.join(', ') || 'None identified'}
- Total tasks tracked: ${previousTasks.length}

PROGRESSIVE TASK GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Build on completed tasks - reference and advance previous wins
2. Address stuck areas with fresh, more specific approaches
3. Generate tasks that are 100% actionable - specific WHO, WHAT, WHEN
4. Include realistic time estimates and measurable success criteria
5. Focus on immediate business value - efficiency, growth, clarity
6. Avoid repetitive, vague, or generic tasks
7. Each task should have clear next steps and completion criteria
8. Use insights from successful task patterns to inform new tasks

TASK QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Be specific about deliverables, tools, timelines, and success metrics
- Include realistic difficulty spread (mix of quick wins and meaningful work)
- Create tasks that compound value and set up future wins
- Focus on what directly moves the business forward - NO FILLER OR FLUFF
- Every task must have clear completion criteria and next steps
- Prioritize tasks that create momentum and compound value
- CRITICAL: For tasks with meaningful business impact, include specific businessImpact object
- Only include businessImpact when the task has clear, measurable potential for business value
- Be conservative but specific with impact estimates

EXECUTION FOCUS:
- Each task should be something that can be completed and checked off
- Avoid "research" or "explore" tasks unless they lead to specific decisions
- Focus on creating, building, implementing, optimizing, or completing
- Tasks should produce tangible outputs that advance business goals
- Prioritize work that increases efficiency, growth, or clarity

For each task, generate specific details that enable immediate action and measurable results.

Return JSON array with this exact structure:

TACTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate 6 DISTINCT task suggestions with varied priorities and approaches
2. Include specific metrics, numbers, and measurable outcomes
3. Prioritize tasks that compound over time (network effects, process improvements)
4. Consider lead times - what needs to start today to meet future deadlines
5. Include tasks that address potential bottlenecks before they occur
6. Focus on leverage points that multiply impact across multiple goals
7. Ensure diversity in task types, difficulty levels, and time commitments

TASK GENERATION CRITERIA:
- Be specific about WHO, WHAT, WHEN, and measurable SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Include industry benchmarks where relevant (e.g., "industry average is X%, aim for Y%")
- Combine analytical insights with actionable next steps
- Vary difficulty levels to maintain momentum while driving growth
- Each task should have clear business justification tied to financial or strategic outcomes
- Rank tasks by importance (1-6, where 1 is highest priority)
- CRITICAL: For tasks with meaningful business impact, include specific businessImpact object with realistic estimates
- Only include businessImpact when the task has clear, measurable potential for business value
- Be conservative but specific with impact estimates - use real industry data when possible
