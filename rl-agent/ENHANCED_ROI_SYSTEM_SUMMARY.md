# Enhanced ROI Calculation System

## üéØ Overview

The Enhanced ROI Calculation System implements a sophisticated, business-intelligence-driven approach to calculating projected ROI for restocking recommendations. This system goes far beyond simple profit calculations to provide accurate, data-driven ROI projections.

## üìä ROI Calculation Formula

### Core Formula
```
Projected ROI = (Expected Revenue - Expected Cost) / Expected Cost √ó 100%
```

### Components Breakdown

#### Expected Revenue
```
Expected Revenue = (Units Likely to Sell) √ó (Selling Price per Unit)
```

#### Expected Cost
```
Expected Cost = (Restock Quantity) √ó (Cost per Unit)
```

#### Units Likely to Sell
```
Units Likely to Sell = min(Restock Quantity, Projected Demand √ó Sell-through Rate)
```

## üîç Calculation Factors

### 1. Historical Sales Rate
- **Daily Sales Average**: Based on historical sales data
- **Sales Velocity Trend**: Whether sales are growing, declining, or stable (-1 to +1 scale)
- **Demand Volatility**: Standard deviation of daily demand patterns

### 2. Unit Profit Margins
- **Cost per Unit**: Actual cost to acquire/produce each unit
- **Selling Price**: Market selling price per unit
- **Unit Profit Margin**: `Selling Price - Cost per Unit`

### 3. Sell-through Probability
- **Historical Sell-through Rate**: Past performance (75-95% typical)
- **Demand vs. Inventory Ratio**: How demand compares to restock quantity
- **Inventory Level Factor**: Adjustment based on current stock levels

### 4. Seasonal and Market Factors
- **Seasonal Multipliers**: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter adjustments
- **Market Conditions**: Overall demand multiplier (economic factors)
- **Competition Factor**: Market competition impact

### 5. Time-based Calculations
- **Time to Stockout**: Days until inventory runs out
- **Stockout Probability**: Likelihood of running out of stock
- **Lead Time**: Days to receive new inventory

## üßÆ Calculation Process

### Step 1: Product Metrics Collection
```python
product_metrics = {
    'cost_per_unit': 45.00,
    'selling_price': 125.00,
    'avg_daily_sales': 12.5,
    'seasonal_factor': 1.2,  # 20% boost for current season
    'historical_sell_through_rate': 0.85,  # 85%
    'demand_volatility': 0.15  # 15% standard deviation
}
```

### Step 2: Demand Projection
```python
projected_demand = (
    base_daily_sales * time_window_days *
    seasonal_factor *
    market_factor *
    trend_factor *
    volatility_factor
)
```

### Step 3: Sell-through Rate Calculation
```python
sell_through_rate = adjust_for_demand_ratio(
    historical_sell_through_rate,
    demand_ratio=projected_demand / restock_quantity
)
```

### Step 4: ROI Calculation
```python
units_likely_to_sell = min(restock_quantity, projected_demand * sell_through_rate)
expected_revenue = units_likely_to_sell * selling_price
expected_cost = restock_quantity * cost_per_unit
projected_roi = (expected_revenue - expected_cost) / expected_cost * 100
```

## üìà Example Calculation

### Scenario: Wireless Headphones Restock

**Input Parameters:**
- Product: Wireless Bluetooth Headphones
- Restock Quantity: 50 units
- Time Window: 30 days

**Product Metrics:**
- Cost per Unit: $45.00
- Selling Price: $125.00
- Average Daily Sales: 2.1 units
- Current Season Factor: 1.1 (10% boost)
- Historical Sell-through: 85%

**Calculation Steps:**

1. **Projected Demand** (30 days):
   ```
   Base demand = 2.1 units/day √ó 30 days = 63 units
   Adjusted demand = 63 √ó 1.1 (seasonal) √ó 1.0 (market) = 69.3 units
   ```

2. **Sell-through Rate**:
   ```
   Demand ratio = 69.3 / 50 = 1.386 (high demand)
   Adjusted sell-through = 85% √ó 1.1 = 93.5%
   ```

3. **Units Likely to Sell**:
   ```
   Units = min(50, 69.3 √ó 0.935) = min(50, 64.8) = 50 units
   ```

4. **Financial Calculations**:
   ```
   Expected Revenue = 50 √ó $125 = $6,250
   Expected Cost = 50 √ó $45 = $2,250
   Expected Profit = $6,250 - $2,250 = $4,000
   ```

5. **ROI Calculation**:
   ```
   ROI = ($4,000 / $2,250) √ó 100% = 177.8%
   ```

## üéØ Confidence Scoring

The system calculates a confidence score (0-100%) based on:

- **Data Quality** (25%): How recent and complete the historical data is
- **Demand Predictability** (25%): Low volatility = higher confidence
- **Historical Accuracy** (25%): Past sell-through performance
- **Market Stability** (15%): Current market conditions
- **Inventory Adequacy** (10%): Sufficient stock for demand patterns

## üîÑ Integration with Enhanced RL System

## üìä Benefits Over Basic Calculation

### Before (Basic):
```python
roi = (revenue - cost) / cost * 100
# Often resulted in unrealistic 200%+ ROI values
```

### After (Enhanced):
```python
roi = sophisticated_calculation_considering(
    historical_sales_rate,
    unit_profit_margins,
    seasonal_factors,
    market_conditions,
    sell_through_probability,
    demand_volatility,
    stockout_risk
)
# Produces realistic 15-85% ROI values with confidence scoring
```
